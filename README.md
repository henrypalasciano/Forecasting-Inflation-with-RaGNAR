# Forecasting UK Consumer Price Inflation with RaGNAR: Random Generalised Network Autoregressive Processes

We forecast inflation using RaGNAR - an ensemble of Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) processes fit to a set of random networks generated according to the Erdos-Renyi-Gilbert model. The nodes in the underlying graphs consist of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) along with its sub-components (divisions, classes, groups).
