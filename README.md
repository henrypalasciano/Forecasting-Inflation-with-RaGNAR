# Forecasting UK Consumer Price Inflation with RaGNAR: Random Generalised Network Autoregressive Processes

This repository contains the Python code used in our article:

ðŸ“„ **"Forecasting UK Consumer Price Inflation with RaGNAR: Random Generalised Network Autoregressive Processes"**  
*(Submitted to the **International Journal of Forecasting**).*

---

## Overview  
We forecast **monthly inflation in the United Kingdom** using **RaGNAR**, an ensemble of **Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) processes** fitted to a set of **random networks** generated according to the **ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyiâ€“Gilbert model**. Nodes represent the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** and its sub-components (*divisions, classes, and groups*).

RaGNAR uses the **GNAR-Python** repository, an implementation of **GNAR models** in python:  
ðŸ”— **[GNAR-Python Repository](https://github.com/henrypalasciano/GNAR-Python.git)**  

---

## Data Source  
The CPI data is publicly available from the UK **Office for National Statistics (ONS)**:  
ðŸ”— [ONS Consumer Price Indices Dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindices)  

For convenience, the script **`download_data.py`** (located in the **`methodology/`** folder) automatically **downloads and prepares the dataset**.

---

## Methodology  
1. Each month, the set of graphs is ranked according to the forecasting performance at the CPI node.  
2. The best-performing graphs are selected and used to forecast inflation.  
3. Multiple forecasts from different GNAR processes and graphs are averaged to produce robust inflation predictions.

The `results/` folder contains forecasts from a **single run** of the RaGNAR algorithm for **reproducibility**.  
This run was carried out on a **2020 MacBook Pro with a 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor**.  

The results are organized as follows:

## Parallel Computation  

The results presented in the article were computed by **averaging 100 runs of RaGNAR**.  

The `parallel_comp.py` script (located in the `methodology` folder) runs RaGNAR **100 times**, saving **RMSEs and MAPEs** for each run in dedicated folders.  
The `average_results.py` script then processes these stored results, computes their averages and standard deviations, and writes them to **various `.txt` files**.  

For the results in the article, the algorithm was executed **in parallel** on the [Maths NextGen Compute Cluster](https://sysnews.ma.ic.ac.uk/NextGen/) at the Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London.

## Example Usage

Below is a minimal example demonstrating how to use **RaGNAR** to forecast UK inflation with the **global** GNAR model class.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from random_graphs import generate_erdos_graphs, compute_ns_mats
from forecasting import forecast_networks, compute_avg_preds, compute_rmse_df
from scoring import cpi_rolling_se, cpi_rolling_mse

# Generate random network graphs
adj_mats = generate_erdos_graphs(10000, 112, 0.03)
ns_mats = compute_ns_mats(adj_mats, 2)

# Load CPI data
cpi_data = pd.read_csv("data/cpi_monthly_data.csv", index_col=0)
cpi_data.index = pd.to_datetime(cpi_data.index)
cpi_data = cpi_data.pct_change(12).dropna(how="all").bfill() * 100

# Set forecasting parameters
p_list = [1, 2, 12, 13, 25]

# Compute rolling squared errors and MSE
se_df = cpi_rolling_se(cpi_data, ns_mats, p_list, 2, start_date="2015-07-01", end_date="2024-11-01", n_train=150, n_shift=1)
mse_df = cpi_rolling_mse(se_df, 30)

# Generate forecasts using the global model
glo_preds = forecast_networks(mse_df, cpi_data, adj_mats, p_list, 2, model_type="global", n_train=150, n_test=1, start_date="2017-12-01", end_date="2024-12-01", h=12, n_best=5)

# Compute average predictions and RMSE
glo_avg = compute_avg_preds(glo_preds, 5)
glo_rmse = compute_rmse_df(glo_avg)
```

## Forecasting Results  

Below is an example of our inflation forecast obtained from a single run of RaGNAR. Forecasts are computed by averaging the predictions of the 5 best networks each month and GNAR models of different orders. The orders across which we average are contained within { } for each model. We compare our forecasts to those of an average of AR processes.
