# Forecasting-Inflation-with-GNAR

Code used in the "Forecasting Inflation Using Generalised Network Autoregressive Processes" article.

In this work we attempt to forecast inflation using an ensemble of Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) processes on random networks generated according to the Erdos-Renyi-Gilbert model. The nodes in the graph consist of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) along with its sub-components (divisions, classes, groups).
