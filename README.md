# Forecasting-Inflation-with-GNAR

Python code used in the "Forecasting Inflation Using Generalised Network Autoregressive Processes" article.

In this work we forecast inflation using an ensemble of Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) processes on a set of random networks generated according to the Erdos-Renyi-Gilbert model. The nodes in the underlying graph consist of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) along with its sub-components (divisions, classes, groups).
